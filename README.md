# dataloading-curation

For files related to data curation for iReceptor Public Archive, including templates for defining sample metadata.

## Test Data

Some test data is also provided in the 'test' subfolder of this project. This data can be used, for example, to learn how to load and to test a fresh 'turnkey-service' project database with its iReceptor data node API web service.  The README file in that test subfolder summarizes what formats of data are provided.
